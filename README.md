#### Statistic for sleep quality (Achieved
- Analysis of sleep quality, motivates the users to keep up the good sleep habit. 
The way we choose to analyze the quality of sleep is sleep hours. The National Sleep Foundation suggests that people should have 8-hour sleep on average. In order to accurately receive the sleep data, an accelerometer sensor is used to detect when the user is awake. The app converts the sleep hours to the in-game rewards that can be used to motivate users to keep up the good sleep habits. All the statistic and computation are automatically processed in the backend, the end-users will receive the corresponding rewards that reflect their sleep quality and habits.

Users can buy a seedling to plant. Different seedlings have different costs as well as earnings rates. The basic free one will be a default choice. Based on sleep quality and the level of the tree, rewards will be given as the number of coins to the users. The suggested sleep time should be 7.5-8.5 hours, for which the user can get 100% of the reward; less than 7.5 will get  (length/7.5 hours)%; 8.5 -12.5 hours will get 100% - (additional time/4.5 hours)%. and nothing for time over 12.5 hours. When the user has enough coins, users are able to upgrade the tree and eventually a real tree is available to plant by contacting us.
